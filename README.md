A mod for the game Lobotomy Corporation that enables realtime control and data exchange with the game via WebSockets.

Any WebSocket client in any programming language should work, but a [TypeScript/JavaScript client library](https://github.com/Hawkbat/lobotomy-corp-bridge/) is available and kept in sync with updates to this server mod.
